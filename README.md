# Smart_Terrace_Gardening

Terrace gardening is a gardening practice where plants, vegetables, herbs, or flowers are cultivated on a terrace or rooftop. It involves creating a garden in containers, raised beds, or other suitable structures on a flat surface like a terrace or balcony. Terrace gardening is popular in urban areas where space for traditional gardens is limited. It allows people to grow a variety of plants and greenery in a small space while also offering benefits like improved air quality, aesthetics, and access to fresh produce.

Challenges in Terrace Gardening:

*Sunlight: Depending on your location, terrace gardens may not receive consistent sunlight, making it essential to choose plants that can thrive in your specific conditions.

*Wind and Weather: Terrace gardens can be exposed to strong winds and extreme weather conditions, which can damage or stress your plants.

*Watering: Watering can be more challenging on a terrace, as pots can dry out quickly. It's important to establish a consistent watering routine.

*Soil Quality: Container gardening requires a suitable potting mix, and over time, it may become depleted of nutrients, requiring regular soil amendment.

*Pests and Disease: Pests and diseases can still affect terrace gardens. You'll need to monitor and address these issues.

Objective:

Our smart terrace gardening project combines innovation and convenience for urban gardeners. Our project is capable of performing three essential functions:

*Automated Rain/Sun Shade for terrace plants: It aims to provide an efficient solution to protect terrace plants from excessive heat. Using temperature sensors, this system deploys a sunshade automatically when high temperatures are detected, ensuring optimal growing conditions. It offers an eco-friendly approach to maintaining healthy plants in urban settings.

*Smart Irrigation System: This system is a smart gardening solution that automates watering based on real-time soil moisture levels. Using sensors and a user-friendly interface, it ensures efficient and precise watering, conserving resources and promoting healthy plant growth in terrace gardens.

*Smart Pest Detection: This terrace garden project employs ultrasonic sensors to detect pests near plants. When a pest is detected, a buzzer is triggered, alerting gardeners to potential threats. This innovative solution enhances plant protection and ensures the well-being of terrace garden vegetation through automated pest detection and timely intervention.
